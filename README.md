# Buffer_Overflow
The Buffer Overflow respository contains a collection of files designed around buffer overflow attack and defense. By exploiting fixed length buffers and overwriting critical stack sections a malicious user can inject malicious code to reroute the control flow of the program and grant unauthorized access. This project is designed to gain experience with such vulnerabilities.
